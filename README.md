# apictx

API context generator for Python libraries. The tool parses source using
LibCST and emits immutable Intermediate Representation objects validated
against a JSON Schema. Generated context enables large language models and
agentic AI to work with private, new, or rapidly evolving libraries without
hallucinating outdated APIs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or newer
